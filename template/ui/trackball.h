  This class represents a trackball camera. It is created with only GLM as
  dependence, (so it can be easily pulled out from the template) and will
  return you a rotation matrix that you can apply between the Model and View
  transformation for representing the camera's rotation.
  It will require you that provide it with an interface with the mouse and
  window system. So you need to tell it every time the window changes size,
  when you start dragging (in which position), when you are dragging (also the
  position) and when you stop dragging.
